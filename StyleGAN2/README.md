# StyleGAN2
StyleGAN2 was proposed to improve the quality of images generated by StyleGAN, by addressing erratic artifacts in the generated images. The root cause for these artifacts were attributed to the adaptive instance normalization. Hence, the generator normalization technique was redesigned and replaced with weight demodulation applied to the weights of each convolutional layers.

## To train StyleGAN2
1. Clone the StyleGAN2 Repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2.git
    ```
2. Install the required libraries.
    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Create Datasets directory inside StyleGAN
    ```
    mkdir -p Datasets    
    ```
4. Create histopathologyImages & histopathologyTFRecords directories inside Datasets
    ```
    mkdir -p  histopathologyImages
    mkdir -p  histopathologyTFRecords
    ```
5. Copy your training images to Datasets/histopathologyImages
    ```
    cp training/images Datasets/histopathologyImages
    ```
6. Prepare the dataset for training
    ```
    python3 dataset_tool.py create_from_images path/to/TFRecords path/to/training/images
    ```
    eg: `python3 dataset_tool.py create_from_image Datasets/histopathologyTFRecords Datasets/histopathologyImages `
7. To train SyleGAN
   ```
   python3 run_training.py --num-gpus=1 --data-dir=Datasets --config=config-f  --dataset=histopathologyTFRecords --mirror-augment=true
   ```
